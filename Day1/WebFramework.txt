3-tier architecute

1) presentaion tier
2) application tier
3) data tier

a three-tier architecture provides a structured approach to designing and implementing software systems,
offering numerous benefits in terms of modularity, scalability, flexibility, performance, security, and maintainability.

Presentation Tier (also known as the User Interface or Client Tier):

    This tier represents the user interface of the application, where interaction with the end user occurs.
    The primary responsibility of this tier is to present information to users and capture user input.

Application Logic Tier (also known as the Business Logic or Middle Tier):

    This tier contains the application logic that processes and manipulates data to implement the business rules and requirements of the application.
    This tier often includes components such as web servers, application servers, and middleware.

Data Tier (also known as the Data Access or Backend Tier):

    This tier manages the storage and retrieval of data used by the application.
    The data tier provides services for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
