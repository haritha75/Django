In Django, the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture is a design pattern that helps in organizing and developing web applications. 


Model:

Models represent the data structure of the application.
Models are created using Django's models.py file within each app, where you define classes that inherit from Django's Model class.
They define the structure of the database tables.
the model is the data layer of the application. 

View:

Views are responsible for handling requests from clients and generating appropriate responses.
Views interact with models to retrieve and manipulate data and then pass the data to templates for rendering.
Views are implemented as Python functions or classes, defined in Django's views.py files within each app.
The primary role of the view function is to fetch the data from the client's request, 
apply a certain processing logic to it and send an appropriate response back to the client. 
The view function calls the render() function to load a template and returns its response to the client. 

Template:

Templates are responsible for generating the presentation layer of the application.
Templates can include variables, control structures, and template tags to generate dynamic content.
They contain HTML markup mixed with Django template language syntax to dynamically render data received from views.
Templates are stored in Django's templates directory within each app, organized based on the app's name.
You place Template web pages in the templates folder with the .html extension.

MVT making it easier to maintain and scale applications.



A Django application consists of the following components: 

    URL dispatcher 

    View 

    Model 

    Template 

True or false. In MVT, routes, views, HTTP requests, and HTTP responses are required for Django to display dynamic text on a webpage.
